## How to run localhost
Navigate to ./src/frontend and run `ng serve` then go to the localhost link. Any changes made there will auto update. 

## Git

To create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

To save your work to your branch locally:
```
git add <file-name OR folder-name>
OR
git add . (to commit whole directory)
THEN
git commit -m "COMMENT TO DESCRIBE THE INTENTION OF THE COMMIT"
```

After committing locally, to push to remote repository:
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Merging and pull requests
